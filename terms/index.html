              <p class="sheet-meta">Last updated: January 13, 2026</p>

              <p>
                Welcome to Ollie. By using our app, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please do not use Ollie.
              </p>

              <h2>1. Using Ollie</h2>
              <p>
                You must be old enough to use your device’s app store and legally able to enter into these terms. You agree to use
                Ollie respectfully and to keep your device secure.
              </p>

              <h2>2. Not medical advice</h2>
              <p>
                Ollie is a calm companion and coach. It does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. If you’re in immediate
                danger or considering self-harm, contact local emergency services or a trusted person right now.
              </p>

              <h2>3. Subscriptions & purchases</h2>
              <p>
                Ollie may offer in‑app purchases, including auto‑renewing subscriptions and a one‑time lifetime purchase. Purchases are
                processed by Apple through the App Store.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Free trials (if offered)</strong>: you will be charged when the trial ends unless you cancel before it ends.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Auto‑renew</strong>: subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the
                  current period (timing and rules are controlled by Apple).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Manage/cancel</strong>: manage or cancel in Apple ID settings on your device.</li>
                <li><strong>Restore</strong>: use “Restore Purchases” in the app to restore eligible purchases.</li>
                <li><strong>Refunds</strong>: refunds are handled by Apple under their policies.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>4. Your content and data</h2>
              <p>
                You own the content you provide (messages, preferences, and check‑ins). You give Ollie permission to process your content
                so the app works (including sending messages to an AI provider to generate replies).
              </p>

              <h2>5. Acceptable use</h2>
              <p>Do not:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Use Ollie to harass, threaten, or harm others.</li>
                <li>Attempt to disrupt, reverse engineer, or misuse the app.</li>
                <li>Use the app for illegal purposes.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
              <p>
                Our <a href="../privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> explains what we collect and how we use it. By using Ollie, you also
                agree to the Privacy Policy.
              </p>

              <h2>7. Service changes and availability</h2>
              <p>
                We may update features, limit access, or stop offering the app. We’ll aim to give notice when changes are significant.
              </p>

              <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
              <p>Ollie is provided “as is” without warranties. We do not promise uninterrupted or error‑free service.</p>

              <h2>9. Limitation of liability</h2>
              <p>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, Ollie and its team are not liable for indirect, incidental, special,
                consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of data, revenue, profits, or goodwill arising from your use of Ollie.
              </p>

              <h2>10. Termination</h2>
              <p>
                You may stop using Ollie at any time. We may suspend or end access if you violate these terms or misuse the app.
              </p>

              <h2>11. Changes to these terms</h2>
              <p>We may update these terms occasionally. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated terms.</p>
