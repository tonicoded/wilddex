              <p class="sheet-meta">Last updated: January 24, 2026</p>

              <p>
                WildDex lets you identify animals from photos and build your own collection. This policy explains what we collect, why,
                and how you stay in control. If you do not agree, please do not use WildDex.
              </p>

              <h2>1. What we collect</h2>
              <p>We collect only what we need to run WildDex:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Profile details</strong>: your chosen Pathfinder name and preferences you set in the app (stored on-device).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Photos you choose to scan</strong>: camera photos or images you import for identification.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Scan results</strong>: identification output (e.g. animal name, rarity/metadata) and timestamps to power your
                  Dex, quests, and stats.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Device/app info</strong>: app version, device/OS version, and limited logs used for support and reliability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Purchase data (if you buy Pro)</strong>: subscription status and entitlement information. Payments are handled
                  by Apple. We may use a third-party provider (RevenueCat) to manage subscription status across devices.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>2. How we store it</h2>
              <p>
                WildDex stores your Dex, scan history, and preferences locally on your device. You can reset data in the app or by
                deleting the app.
              </p>

              <h2>3. How we use data</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Operate the app (scanning, identification, and your collection).</li>
                <li>Power quests, achievements, levels, and progress tracking.</li>
                <li>Provide support when you contact us.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>4. Sharing</h2>
              <p>We do not sell your personal data. WildDex may share limited information with service providers:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>AI provider</strong>: to identify animals, the photo(s) you submit (and small processed variants like crops)
                  may be sent to the configured AI provider (e.g. OpenAI) to generate a result.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Apple</strong>: for App Store distribution and any in-app purchases (if offered).</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>RevenueCat (Pro)</strong>: subscription management/verification (checking Pro entitlement, restoring purchases).
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>5. Retention and control</h2>
              <p>
                You control what you scan. You can revoke camera/photo permissions in iOS Settings at any time. You can delete local
                data by resetting the app’s data (if available) or deleting the app.
              </p>

              <h2>6. Security</h2>
              <p>
                We use encryption in transit when communicating with providers, and we encourage strong device security
                (passcode/Face ID) since your data is stored locally on your device.
              </p>

              <h2>7. Children</h2>
              <p>WildDex is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>

              <h2>8. International use</h2>
              <p>
                Third-party providers may process data in countries other than where you live. We apply the protections described here
                regardless of location.
              </p>

              <h2>9. Changes</h2>
              <p>
                We may update this policy. We will notify you through the app when changes are significant. Continuing to use WildDex
                means you accept the updated policy.
              </p>
